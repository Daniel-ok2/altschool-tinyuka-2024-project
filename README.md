# AltSchool Tinyuka 2024 First Semester Project: Expense Tracker

## Project Description
This project implements an expense tracking system using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It consists of two classes:
- **Expense**: Represents a single financial expense with attributes like ID, title, amount, and timestamps.
- **ExpenseDatabase**: Manages a collection of `Expense` objects with methods to add, remove, and retrieve expenses.

The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in OOP, including class definitions, attributes, methods, and time handling.
